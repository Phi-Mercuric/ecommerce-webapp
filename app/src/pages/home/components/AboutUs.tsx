        About us
      </h1>

        We are a group of engineers, coders, enthusiasts, and hobbiests who are interested in Nixie tubes.
        While we were looking for parts to build our own clocks, we noticed that finding and sourcing parts
        and finding clocks was extremely difficult and confusing. We seek to change that here.
        <br /> <br />
        We are not a company, we are not a business, we are not a store. We are a group of people who want to
        make it easier for people to find parts to build their own clocks. At the same time, we do offer our
        services to build custom clocks for you. However, we even provide alternatives to ourselves to give
        you the best options possible.
